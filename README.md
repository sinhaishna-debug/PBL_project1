# Crop Disease Detector with Weather-Based Early Warning

This repository contains the **PBL Mid-Term Presentation Project**
for the Department of Computer Science & Engineering,
Manipal University Jaipur.

## Project Description
The project proposes a hybrid machine learning system that combines:
- CNN-based crop disease detection using leaf images
- Weather-based disease risk prediction using climate parameters

## Current Status
🔹 Design and planning phase  
🔹 Implementation scheduled for next PBL phase

## Proposed Technologies
- Python
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Machine Learning (Random Forest / XGBoost / LSTM)
- Weather data analysis
- Web-based dashboard
